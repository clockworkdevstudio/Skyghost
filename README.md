# Skyghost
## Asteroid shooter for Linux and Windows

This game was written over the course of about a week to test and demonstrate my BASIC compiler Idlewild-Lang. It uses vector graphics and has a fairly sophisticated physics engine so it's a bit heavy on the maths. Apologies for the admittedly very untidy source code. The game is *almost* source-compatible with Blitz BASIC/Blitzplus (it uses at least one 3D graphics function I introduced myself).

## INSTALL (LINUX)

To install dependencies on a (RECENT!) version of Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0`

Now run the game with:

`./skyghost`

## INSTALL (WINDOWS)

To install on Windows, just unzip the archive in any folder. To run, double-click `skyghost.exe`.

## PLAY

Use the arrow keys to control your spaceship. Use CTRL or SPACE to shoot the asteroids. Use P to pause the game and ESC to exit. Earth is counting on you, Skyghost!
