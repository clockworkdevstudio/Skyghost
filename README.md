# Skyghost
## Asteroid shooter for MacOS, Linux and Windows

* This game was written over the course of about a week to test and demonstrate my BASIC compiler Idlewild-Lang. It uses vector graphics and has a fairly sophisticated physics engine so it's a bit heavy on the maths. Apologies for the admittedly very untidy source code. The game is *almost* source-compatible with Blitz BASIC/Blitzplus (it uses at least one 3D graphics function I introduced myself).
* You will need Idlewild-Lang (or at least its multimedia dependencies) installed in order to run the game.
* Use the arrow keys to control your spaceship. Use CTRL or SPACE to shoot the asteroids. Use P to pause the game and ESC to exit. Earth is counting on you, Skyghost!
